# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
-- Deep Neural Network(from MNIST dataset) to detect handwritten digits
-- Adapted a basic Auto-encoder from the mathworks documentation mentioned below
-- Used the Auto-Encoders to train MNIST dataset
-- Accuracy around 99% for both datasets -> dervived from confusion matrix
--
