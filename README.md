# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

-- Deep Neural Network(from MNIST dataset) to detect handwritten digits

-- Adapted a basic Auto-encoder from the mathworks documentation mentioned below (deeplearningNORMAL.m)

-- Used the Auto-Encoders to train MNIST dataset (deepLearningMNIST.m)

-- Accuracy around 99% for both datasets -> dervived from confusion matrix
