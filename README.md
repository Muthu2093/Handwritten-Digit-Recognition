# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

-- Deep Neural Network(from MNIST dataset) to detect handwritten digits

-- Adapted a basic Auto-encoder from the mathworks documentation mentioned below

-- Used the Auto-Encoders to train MNIST dataset

-- Accuracy around 99% for both datasets -> dervived from confusion matrix
--
